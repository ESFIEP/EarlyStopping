- [ ] Add method name to the CG print: "Transformed residual vector is zero. Algorithm terminates at iteration 13.
"
- [ ] Add warning message when oracle iteration is not found
- [ ] Update docu landweber
- [ ] Add a proper code documentation for the simmulation wrapper

# Next Steps

- [x] Apply on CG and landweber
- [x] Make it possible to pass the response from outside
- [x] Add relative efficiencies to the simmulation wrapper
- [ ] Create one composition of the boxplots for comparing the different datasets with one view by returning the plots for the documentation
